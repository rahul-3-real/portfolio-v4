        Back in 2019, I started my journey in web development by creating my
        first website, <b className="text-light">MeeN'Music</b>, where users
        could listen to, download, and read song lyrics. Though it faced
        copyright issues, it sparked my passion for programming and design. I
        did courses and pursued my interest in{" "}
        <b className="text-light">programming</b>,{" "}
        <b className="text-light">freelancing</b>, and working on{" "}
        <b className="text-light">personal projects</b>. which allowed me to
        develop a wide range of skills across various web technologies.

      <p className="mb-5">
        Over the years, I've built websites for{" "}
        <b className="text-light">local businesses</b> and worked at{" "}
        <b className="text-light">various companies</b>, gaining practical
        experience in real-world projects that challenged me to continually
        grow. I enjoy the{" "}
        <b className="text-light">blend of design and development</b>, striving
        to create beautiful, functional, and optimized websites. While I prefer
        working solo, collaborating with like-minded people has taught me the
        value of teamwork and shared creativity.

        As a <b className="text-light">self-taught developer</b>, I'm always
        exploring new technologies and pushing myself to stay ahead of the curve
        in the rapidly evolving world of development. What drives me is the
        pursuit of creating <b className="text-light">smooth</b>,{" "}
        <b className="text-light">engaging experiences</b> that not only look
        great but are also intuitive and highly functional for users.
